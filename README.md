# 🖼️ OpenCV Project on Sublime Text 3

This is a simple project to try OpenCV with Sublime Text 3. 🧪💻

## 🚧 Current Status

- ✅ The project **successfully compiles** and generates an `.exe` file in the `Debug` folder.
- ⚠️ However, there's an issue with debugging: you **can't use `Ctrl + Shift + B`** to debug the project directly from Sublime Text.
- 🖱️ Currently, the executable can **only be run manually** by double-clicking the `.exe` file inside the `Debug` directory.

## 🔧 Next Steps

I believe the problem lies in the **build system configuration** in Sublime Text. 🛠️  
I'm planning to fix this so I can debug or run the project more conveniently using `Ctrl + Shift + B`. 🚀
