# OpenCV Project on Sublime Text 3

This is a simple project to try OpenCV with Sublime Text 3.

## Current Status

- The project successfully compiles and generates an `.exe` file in the `Debug` folder.
- However, there's an issue with debugging: you **can't use `Ctrl + Shift + B`** to debug the project from Sublime Text directly.
- Currently, the executable can **only be run manually** by double-clicking the `.exe` file inside the `Debug` directory.

## Next Steps

I believe the problem lies in the **build system configuration** in Sublime Text. I'm planning to fix this to allow proper debugging and easier execution through the build shortcut.
